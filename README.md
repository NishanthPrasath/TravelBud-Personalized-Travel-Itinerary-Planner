### Optimization 
**Location Optimization:**

At Travel Bud, we understand that time is a valuable commodity for travelers, and therefore, we strive to provide the most efficient and effective itinerary planning experience possible. Our optimization algorithm is designed to retrieve the top 10 locations from the Google Maps API based on the user's destination, ensuring that they have access to the best and most popular local attractions.

Once the user selects their areas of interest from the 10 available options, our algorithm creates pairs of two locations that are in close proximity to each other. This ensures that the user can visit both locations in a single day, maximizing their vacation experience and making the most of their time. If there are any remaining locations, the user can visit them on their last day, making their itinerary as comprehensive as possible.

We understand that every traveler is different and has unique needs and preferences. Therefore, we recommend the optimal number of locations for the user to visit based on the number of days they plan to stay at their destination. Typically, we recommend no more than twice the number of days the user plans to stay, ensuring that they have enough time to relax and enjoy their vacation.

**Booking Optimization:**

We understand that budget is a key factor for many travelers when planning their vacation. Therefore, we offer the option for users to select their desired start and end days and budget, allowing them to tailor their itinerary to their specific needs.

Using this information, our algorithm creates groupings of all possible options and searches for hotels and airlines that fit the user's criteria. We search for options that fit within the user's budget, while also ensuring that they have access to the best possible accommodations and flights.

Our algorithm then finds the optimal cost that fits the user's budget, giving them the best possible experience for their money. Users can choose from four airline options: best, cheapest, fastest, and direct, providing them with the flexibility to select the airline that best suits their needs.

In cases where the user's budget does not match their desired options, we recommend the lowest possible cost to the user, ensuring that they get the most out of their vacation while saving money.

Overall, our optimization algorithms for location and booking ensure that Travel Bud users have the best possible vacation experience while also optimizing their time and budget.
